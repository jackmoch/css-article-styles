      <h2>The Origins Of Blues</h2>
      <p>What is the blue note? The funkiest of record labels? The e# that inspired Picasso? A barely legible post-it? I don't know man, just play the damn guitar!</p>

      <h2>What Does Jazz Mean to You?</h2>
      <p>Old people. Mahogany. Marble chess sets. Horn rimmed glasses. Heroin withdrawals. Bill Evans is NOT a mere mortal, in perspective my fingers feel flimsy. Cascading nonsense organizes naturally. Chaos is controlled only in its submission to its own anarchy. I feel dissonance in the griding of my teeth. Gnashing, gnawing and guffawing. A Love Supreme - A Dream Suppressed - A Being Surpassed - Passant En Prose </p>

      <h2>"Living A Spiritual Life"</h2>
      <p>"In terms of my own body and my soul, there are four things I do: Do good work, one. Be kind, two. Three, avoid hypocrisy. And four, try and help as many people as I can while I'm alive. This is what living a spiritual life means to me." - Haki Madhubuti</p>

    <article class="time">
      <h2>Take Time to Make Time</h2>
      <p>Not having any time to do anything implies the paradox of needing time to figure out when you can make time to do something! In the words of many a revolutionary "IT'S A TRAP!"</p>

      <h2>The Wall</h2>
      <p>Oh my, what to do now?! Where do we go from here? Stepping forward calls for a stone and stepping back, a mistake. Rally your rocks gents, for the times they are a changing.</p>
